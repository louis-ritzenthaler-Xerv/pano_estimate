Here are the different infos about the beta app : 
_________________________________________________

As of august of 2024, an existing "app" solution exists, using jotform. (https://www.jotform.com/)
The current state of this beta app is a template that can be used by anyone with the link povided at the bottom of this file.

To use it, simply open the link, create or use a Jotform account and get the forms. Then use the "Create the app" in the publish tab.
It is located on the left side of the form when you open the form editor.

The usage of this template is intended as a "preview" and a way to determine if the app fits the needs it has to fulfil. 
Usage of this template is obviously free, but it should not be a final solution due to Jotform's limitations, the app will not
be as good as it is in its released version. (Not available as of August the 19th of 2024, it is currently being worked on).
